This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

## Overview

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.

#### Supported Architectures

Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS (Darwin), and [Android](https://gist.github.com/bep/a0d8a26cf6b4f8bc992729b8e50b480b) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.

Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Solaris.

**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation][].**

## Choose How to Install

If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.
The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.

To contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should [fork the Hugo GitHub project](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.

Finally, you can install the Hugo source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.
Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.

### Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)

Use the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/).

### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)

#### Prerequisite Tools

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Go (latest or previous version)](https://golang.org/dl/)

#### Vendored Dependencies

Hugo uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to vendor dependencies, but we don't commit the vendored packages themselves to the Hugo git repository. Therefore, a simple `go get` is _not_ supported because the command is not vendor aware.

The simplest way is to use [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage) (a Make alternative for Go projects.)

#### Fetch from GitHub

```bash
go get github.com/magefile/mage
go get -d github.com/gohugoio/hugo
cd ${GOPATH:-$HOME/go}/src/github.com/gohugoio/hugo
mage vendor
mage install
```

**If you are a Windows user, substitute the `$HOME` environment variable above with `%USERPROFILE%`.**
	
## The Hugo Documentation

The Hugo documentation now lives in its own repository, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs. But we do keep a version of that documentation as a `git subtree` in this repository. To build the sub folder `/docs` as a Hugo site, you need to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gohugoio/hugo.git
```
## Contributing to Hugo

For a complete guide to contributing to Hugo, see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We welcome contributions to Hugo of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.

The Hugo community and maintainers are [very active](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pulse/monthly) and helpful, and the project benefits greatly from this activity.

### Asking Support Questions

We have an active [discussion forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io) where users and developers can ask questions.
Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions.

### Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a defect in Hugo or its documentation, use
the GitHub issue tracker to report the problem to the Hugo maintainers.
If you're not sure if it's a bug or not, start by asking in the [discussion forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io).
When reporting the issue, please provide the version of Hugo in use (`hugo version`).

### Submitting Patches

The Hugo project welcomes all contributors and contributions regardless of skill or experience level.
If you are interested in helping with the project, we will help you with your contribution.
Hugo is a very active project with many contributions happening daily.

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users and the best contribution experience for our developers,
we have a set of guidelines which ensure that all contributions are acceptable.
The guidelines are not intended as a filter or barrier to participation.
If you are unfamiliar with the contribution process, the Hugo team will help you and teach you how to bring your contribution in accordance with the guidelines.

For a complete guide to contributing code to Hugo, see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
