This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

## Overview

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data.
And you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.

## Contributing to Hugo

We welcome contributions to Hugo of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.

The Hugo community and maintainers are [very active](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pulse/monthly) and helpful, and the project benefits greatly from this activity.

### Asking Support Questions

We have an active [discussion forum](http://discuss.gohugo.io) where users and developers can ask questions.
Please don't use the Github issue tracker to ask questions.

### Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a defect in Hugo or its documentation, use
the Github issue tracker to report the problem to the Hugo maintainers.
If you're not sure if it's a bug or not, start by asking in the [discussion forum](http://discuss.gohugo.io).
When reporting the issue, please provide the version of Hugo in use (`hugo version`).

    <releaseNotes># **0.29** September 26th 2017

Hugo `0.29` brings Template Metrics by [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason). Hugo is very fast, but it is still possible to write ineffective templates. Now these should be easy to identify. Just run:

```bash
hugo --templateMetrics
```
Now, that was the tasty carrot. The real reason this release comes so fast after the last one is to change the default value for the new `noHTTPCache` flag, which gives away too much performance to make sense as a default value.

Hugo now has:

* 19817+ [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 454+ [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 180+ [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes
* Make `noHTTPCache` default false [e94d4f01](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/e94d4f0177852b357f40fb9686a0ff3667d86351) [@bep](https://github.com/bep)
